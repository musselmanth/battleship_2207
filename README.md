# Battleship 2207

## About

This is a fully functional Battleship game with a command-line user interface. It was written in Ruby using Object Oriented Programming principles. It includes a semi-intelligent computer opponent. It was a two-person paired project for the Turing School of Software and Design, with a timeline of 1.5 weeks.

## Learning Goals

- Use RSpec and TDD to ensure application is fully tested.
- Use the principles of OOP to organize code.
- Practice algorithmic thinking.
- Learn to collaborate on a paired project using Git and GitHub

## Ruby Version

This project uses Ruby 2.7.2

## Install / Setup

- Ensure Ruby 2.7.2 is installed using your preferred method.
- Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:musselmanth/battleship_2207.git`
- `cd battleship_2207`
- Run the program using `ruby battleship_runner.rb`

## Notable Accomplishments

- Used algorithms to develop a semi-intelligient computer that fires on cells adjancent to other hits, with strongest preferences given to cells with multiple adjacent hit cells in a row.
